     <h3>Black beans</h3>
      <p>Black beans are a staple in many Mexican and Brazilian dishes. 
           They have a velvety-smooth texture and mild flavor. 
           They also have a lower glycemic index than many other high-carb foods, 
           helping to reduce the spike in blood sugar that occurs after eating a meal.
           Add them to salads, soups, casseroles, or tacos for added protein.
           They also make a healthy substitute for meat or even flour!

      <h3>Kidney Beans</h3>
      <p>These beans are known for their vibrant red skin and white interior. 
         They have a mild flavor, and make the perfect addition to any chili recipe. 
          Fun fact: Kidney beans have about the same amount of cancer-fighting antioxidants as blueberries.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="step">
      <h3>Pinto Beans</h3>
        <p>Pinto beans have an orange-pink color with rust-colored specks. 
        Pinto actually means "painted" in Spanish. They're loaded with fiber and protein too. 
        Their earthy flavor and smooth texture makes them great for dips and stews, or of course, 
        refried beans..</p>
